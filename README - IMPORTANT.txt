welcome to OSINT library
OSINT is not a python program, OSINT is a python library 
it is an exhausting task to create a pentration testing program from scratch
so osint library was created to put an end to your suffering ("by taking off your oxygen mask. just joking about the oxygen mask")
and osint library is used for creating python programs used for information gathering.
you can create a python program for information gathering from scratch or you can simply type next


import osint


and then use premade prototypes for creating your osint python program
you think of it as lego game. where you attach premade pieces together to create an object

and we know you hate the boring part of documentation and you want to straightly get into the sexy part
of "breaking stuffs and causing mayhem and damages and massacres with an evil laughter like a sadistic psychopath" 
but your penetration testing mentor said "Hey wait!! don't run away!! you HAVE TO do documentation!! and by you HAVE TO I really
mean you HAVE TO!!"
and don't worry I understand your suffering, that's why this program has an automatic documentation program that documents every action you
make and saves them in a json file. and make sure to adjust the documentation class to fit your needs

and it requires few libraries that does not come up with python 3. so you have to run init.sh using command promopt
and it will take care of everything through the apt in pip. and make sure to add the path to your python library
as a first parameter to the init.sh file.

this program has the next premade prototypes:
	now 					:	get the current date and time
	documentation			:	automatically used to document every activity used by this program
	get_geolocation 		: 	getting the geolocation of IP address
	ipToHost				:	convert IP to link
	hostToIp				:	convert link to IP
	lookupfor				:	get wide data about target
	whois					:	get info about target using whois program
	portscan				:	looking up for available open ports
	get_exif_data			:	get exif data from a picture
	extract_links			:	looking for links in a webpage
	rainbowAttack			:	looking for the password in a list of possible passwords that matches the hashed image of a target passowrd
	war_dial				:	looking for phone numbers that are used for modems
	phoneNumberToCountry	:	looking for the country that has the phone number
	countryToPhoneNumber	:	looking for the phone number of the mentioned country
